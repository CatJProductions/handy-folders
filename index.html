    <p>Hello!<br>Handy Folders is a small group that sells artistic creations, including origami, sewing products, and drawings. We give 25 to 30 percent of our earnings to charity, such as Lin Manuel Miranda's Puerto Rico charity.</p>
    <p>Here is a game made by the CEO!</p>
    <h2>Thanksgiving Event</h2>
    <p>Handy Folders is having a Thanksgiving Event! In some of the origami models you purchase, you may find a buy one get one free coupon! They expire on December ninth. Also, all bird origami models are free, including hens!</p>
    <h2>Origami</h2>
    <p>We specialize in origami, making from classic paper cranes to chinese jumping frogs and even samurai helmets! Check out our origami page (Up on the bar on top) to see all the models we make, and stuff about them!</p>
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>Depending on the style of paper we use for origami models, prices will range from $0.40 to $1.00. 1 dollar may seem like a lot of money, but that is the price for models made with some of our most beautiful paper!</p>
    <p>The only sewing product we make currently is hand warmers. They sell for $8.00 a pair. Go to our sewing section for instructions on how to use them!</p>
